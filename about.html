          <p>
            My focus is on male wellness, which includes understanding moral injury, dealing with how men are taught to cope in ways that are hurtful to them as well as how men often struggle in areas of self-esteem, employment, relationships, parenting, isolation and substance use. I will also advocate to help get men’s issues in the spotlight and create space to promote men’s bonding and mental health. 
            I help people identify and move towards their goals by helping you determine what you want out of your life. When appropriate, I will challenge you in a sensitive and helpful manner.

            <h3 class = 'aboutHeader'>Humanistic</h4>
            <p>
              I am empathetic, non-judgmental and patient. I recognize how society and circumstances impact behavior and choices and prioritize building relationships with people where they feel safe, comfortable and validated. I believe it is paramount to overcome stigma and shame; I relay that mental health challenges are a normal part of being human. Life is not easy. We all need help at times. It takes courage to ask and get help.

            <h3 class = 'aboutHeader'>Recovery oriented and person centered</h4>
            <p>
              I will learn about your environment and circumstances and how that may contribute to behavior and choices and I appreciate why people may use maladaptive coping strategies (addiction, anger) to deal with stress.  I steer away from therapeutic approaches that may cause the you to feel unheard or unvalidated.

            <h3 class = 'aboutHeader'>Trauma informed</h4>
            <p>
              I have extensive history working with veterans with history of childhood, combat and sexual trauma. I understand how trauma can shatter one’s sense of safety and trust in others. I will create a safe environment, built on caring and understanding where you can open up and rely on me.

            <h3 class = 'aboutHeader'>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with Problem Solving</h4>
            <p>
              I am very skilled at helping you question your thoughts and perceptions of problems to help see it in a new context or light. I may use Socratic questioning to help you explore how your thoughts are impacting your feelings, perceptions and beliefs.  By creating different ways of viewing situations I can help you effectively problem solve.

            <h1 id = 'statementHeader'>Improving Emotional Health</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
              I understand that to make strides to improve our lives, our relationships, our sense
              of purpose, we need to address our emotional health.
              I provide psychotherapy and professional problem solving. Life throws us
              curveballs at times, and in these moments great change is possible. I aim to help
              people understand these moments for the sake of healing, and for building positive
              change. I consider it a great privilege to be part of another person's healing
              process. I work with adults of all ages, from early adulthood to end of life.
              As a professional problem solver I provide solution focused consultation when next
              steps in life are uncertain. I also provide in depth psychotherapy when current or
              life long challenges become unmanageable. I am formally trained in several
              evidence based psychotherapy treatments, and I tailor all psychotherapy to the
              specific unique needs of each client.
              It can be hard to know where to start, hard to know what to do. I prioritize getting
              people started soon after making contact, as it is not helpful to have to wait for 1-2
              months to see a provider when one finally feels ready to take the next step. I look
              forward to hearing from you.
