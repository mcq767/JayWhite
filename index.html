                Asking for help, being true to ourselves, finding a level of comfort within ourselves
              and forming a strong emotional wellbeing are aspects of a man’s life that are often
              overlooked or underdeveloped. Without this element of us being constructed, we
              may be struggling more than we need to be. We may be preventing ourselves from
              living our fullest life.

              <h4>Self Knowledge</h4>
              <p>
                Men will acquire a greater sense of self through increasing their emotional wellness. Achieving
                this can be done in a shared space, that is safe and free of common, every-day pressures.
                There are all sorts of activities, events, and opportunities that will provide skills-sharing and open
                dialogue for which meaningful conversations will arise. This environment will lead to richer
                knowledge of self and develop robust and sustainable confidence.

                "I have had the opportunity to work with the Veteran community for nearly two
                decades and I have concluded that much of what we may struggle with is more
                common than you may know. You can find relief in working on your emotional
                wellbeing and that kind of relief can unlock your potential to improve your
                experience and find the avenue to your purpose."

              <p>
                Goals of my practice include assisting participants with becoming part of a
                community, to feel safe freely expressing themselves, to face fears in a healthy and nurturing
                way, to create a sustainable pate to a balanced lifestyle, to build confidence, to increase
                relationship-building skills, to find, restore, and maintain a sense of purpose, to learn and/or share
                physical skills, to travel, to increase their life network, and to give back to the community.
