                Asking for help, being true to ourselves, finding a level of comfort within ourselves
              and forming a strong emotional wellbeing are aspects of a man’s life that are often
              overlooked or underdeveloped. Without this element of us being constructed, we
              may be struggling more than we need to be. We may be preventing ourselves from
              living our fullest life.

                Jay White Counseling offers both in-person and telephone sessions to fit your
                comfort level. I can also be available in early morning, later afternoon or weekend
                hours. I promote an open-minded concept that will fit you specifically--using your
                strengths and working on pieces you want to work on--and I believe in meeting you
                “where you are,” in life. We can move at your speed. If you want to be challenged,
                that is up to you. Let’s do it! Time to start to get on track and enjoy life!

                "I have had the opportunity to work with the Veteran community for nearly two
                decades and I have concluded that much of what we may struggle with is more
                common than you may know. You can find relief in working on your emotional
                wellbeing and that kind of relief can unlock your potential to improve your
                experience and find the avenue to your purpose."

              <h4>Self Knowledge</h4>
              <p>
                Men will acquire a greater sense of self through increasing their emotional wellness. Achieving
                this can be done in a shared space, that is safe and free of common, every-day pressures.
                There are all sorts of activities, events, and opportunities that will provide skills-sharing and open
                dialogue for which meaningful conversations will arise. This environment will lead to richer
                knowledge of self and develop robust and sustainable confidence.
